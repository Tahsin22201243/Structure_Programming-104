## 🧩 What is Structured Programming?

Structured Programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes clear, logical structure in code.  
It helps developers write programs that are **easier to read, debug, test, and maintain** by dividing a problem into smaller, well-organized blocks.

### ✨ Key Principles
- **Sequence** – instructions are executed in a clear, top-to-bottom order.  
- **Selection** – decisions are made using control structures like `if/else` and `switch`.  
- **Iteration** – repetitive tasks are handled with loops such as `for`, `while`, or `do-while`.  
- **Modularity** – code is broken into reusable functions or procedures.

### ✅ Benefits
- Improves code readability and reduces complexity.
- Makes testing and debugging much easier.
- Encourages reuse of code and avoids duplication.
- Forms the foundation for many modern programming practices.

### 📝 In Short
Structured Programming is about writing **organized, predictable, and efficient code** by using clear control structures instead of arbitrary jumps like `goto`. It’s the backbone of languages such as **C, Pascal, Java, Python, and C++**.
